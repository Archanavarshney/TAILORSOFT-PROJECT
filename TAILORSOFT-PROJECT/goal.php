<p>
Goal setting is one of the most critical steps in effective performance management. Too often, managers and employees set goals that are not SMART or in line with corporate strategies, resulting in lost productivity and disengaged workers. Goal management is more than just a once-a-year exercise – it is an opportunity to align the focus of the entire company, clarify performance expectations, and guide employees to success.

<font size="4px">EPR Portal makes it easy to align employee goals with business objectives and effectively guide employee performance and development year-round.</font>

</p>
<br />
<p>
EPR Portal’s flexible performance reviews helps link employee goals to the departmental goals, and to organizational goals - ensuring every employee is devoting his or her time and attention to critical and important activities.
</p>
<br />
<font size="4px">Goal Cascading</font>
<br />
<br />
<p>
Corporate goals and objectives can be cascaded down throughout the organization to departments and to individual employees. This ensures that the goals of all the employees are aligned to optimize organizational performance and to achieve success. Goal cascading also helps the employee develop his or her own personal goals and objectives and link them to corporate goals.

<font size="4px">More than Just Goals</font>
<br />
<br />
<p>EPR Portal allows you to evaluate employees on more than just goals. Some possible evaluation criteria can include learning and development, professional compliance, competencies and training.

EPR Portal’s flexible review forms can be configured to have as many or as few evaluation areas as needed.
. Training initiatives can be planned before the evaluation cycle begins and like goals, they can be monitored and tracked by managers until completed. Best of all, once completed, EPR Portal will contain an official record of training initiatives that have been completed
